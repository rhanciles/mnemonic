## Overview

We live in a world where many around us are doing the heavy lifting. Chasing a career, finding that dream job, getting married, raising a family, running a business, etc. In as much as all of these things are vital for many of us, and we wouldn’t be where we are today without that drive and determination. Yet, when all is said and done, amidst all hustle and bustle, we find that it’s the simple things in life that really counts. That beaming smile from your child, a friendly handshake for a stranger, or that pat on the back by you mum/dad with a simple “well done”. The joy of having a new car, being promoted at work or eve that dream holiday to Dubai, may soon fade away. But these little memories, such as when your daughter first called you daddy, somehow lingers on.

I sincerely hope that ‘mnemonic’ will do just that because that’s the plan. Peel away all the sophistication that technology as successfully swamped us with, and become that simple app, addressing that simple need, in a very simple way. As the name implies, it’s the app that helps you remember things as you go about your daily activities. Yes, there are many apps that do just that do just that – I can see that question coming – so what so different about this on. Well, simply put, this app is not a notepad or notebook where you write several lines of text and save to interact with over time. Rather, it is the electronic version of that little piece of paper you put in your pocket when you go out shopping in order to remember that one thing you might just forget. It’s not an alarm, nor a todo list, or a file you can save, neither anything with a complicated structure or design that becomes daunting even for the tech savvy minds. Each item on your list is represented by a simple box that you delete when done, just like the piece of paper in your pocket that you discard once back from shopping.

## Description

The ‘mnemonic’ App is designed from the ground up to be fool proof. As long as you can use a phone/computer and you can scribble a few lines, you can use this App. At this stage of development, it opens up with an empty page/screen which becomes populated by text boxes as you add information to it. Each box contains a single line of text, or icon based on the user’s preference. The beauty of it is that once developed to its full potential, your reminder does not have to be normal text. It can be a scribbly only you understand, or an icon or emoji that serves the same purpose. It gets even more handy when you can simply click on the number you wrote and call that person or even a cab.

## Mock-up

## Usage

As you can see from the mock-up it’s quite quick and easy to use out of the box. The name and purpose of the app is all the instructions you need. However, I have no doubt that like minded developers would want to know what’s under the hood. So far - because it’s early days yet like I mentions earlier - the code has been compiled with HTML, jQuery, Vanila JavaScript, a bit of React and Motoko on the back end. Motoko just happened to be the latest addition to my bag of tricks and happens to be the catalyst behind this project. The ability to build an app on a secure platform that acts very much like an open source at its core, because of its de-centralised model, is a good thing to have. One, I’m sure many developers will soon be adopting as the Motoko steam train gains momentum.

This Repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. I have added comments to all the relevant sections of the code, highlighting key areas and the expected result derived from it. The content comprise only what is related to the task and I have kept the interface very simple and straight forward to use. It also contains an animated image of the mock-up depicting the final product.
